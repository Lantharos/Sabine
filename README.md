# Sabine

Sabine is a native application framework built around one shared Chromium runtime.
Write your UI in the web stack you already use, keep a real desktop window, and share one
browser engine across every Sabine app on the machine.

## Install

Building Sabine or an application requires Rust 1.90 or newer. Installed applications do not require Rust.

```toml
[dependencies]
sabine = { git = "https://github.com/Lantharos/Sabine", tag = "v0.28" }
```

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Lantharos/Sabine --tag v0.28 sabine-cli
```

Run `sabine -V` or `sabine --version` to see the CLI version, installed shared service version,
and running daemon version separately. If the service is missing or the daemon is stopped, the
output says so. This only reads local state; it does not start the daemon or check for updates.
Shared service updates do not replace a separately installed CLI.

For the TypeScript helpers used by the web UI:

```sh
bun add github:Lantharos/Sabine#v0.28
```

## Why Sabine

- One shared Chromium runtime across Linux, Windows, and macOS (Apple Silicon)
- Native windows with GPU composition, glass materials, trays, and palettes
- Guests for embedded tabs, previews, auth flows, and untrusted pages
- Typed Rust ↔ web bridge with explicit command and origin permissions
- Shared service that owns first-run setup, the Chromium runtime, and future tools
- Visible progress while the first app prepares the machine for every Sabine app
- One `Sabine.toml` for app identity, web assets, and packaging
- Lifecycle controls for background windows, tray apps, and browser-style workloads
- TypeScript package for invoke, guests, window controls, native file drops, activity, and popups

## Quick start

```sh
sabine new my-app
cd my-app
sabine dev
```

Generated apps look like this:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(target_os = "windows", windows_subsystem = "windows")]

use sabine::prelude::*;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct VersionRequest {}

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct VersionResponse {
    version: &'static str,
}

fn main() {
    SabineWindow::main(|window| {
        Ok(window
            .app()
            .background_color(SabineColor::rgb8(15, 17, 21))
            .size(960, 640)
            .bridge_typed("app.version", |_request: VersionRequest| {
                Ok(VersionResponse {
                    version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
                })
            }))
    });
}
```

```js
import { invoke, guest, appWindow, listen, events } from "@lantharos/sabine";

const { version } = await invoke("app.version");
listen("tray.click", () => appWindow.show());
events.fileDrag(({ phase, paths, x, y, action }) => {
  console.log(phase, paths, x, y, action);
});

const tab = await guest.create({
  url: "https://example.com",
  bounds: { x: 16, y: 64, width: 900, height: 600 },
  partition: "persist:browser",
});
```

On first launch (or `sabine dev`), Sabine prepares and validates the shared Chromium runtime when it
is missing. App launches register with the shared Sabine service and later runs reuse the verified
install. `sabine dev` owns the web development process; the app only connects to the configured
development URL.

## Window recipes

```rust
// Standard desktop app
SabineWindow::new().app();

// Transparent palette or launcher
SabineWindow::new().palette();

// Background tray app
SabineWindow::new()
    .tray_app()
    .tray_icon(/* ... */)
    .single_instance_id("com.example.my-app");

// Custom titlebar and sidebar glass regions
SabineWindow::new()
    .frameless()
    .glass()
    .app_chrome(AppChrome::new(38, 260));
```

Embed another page as a guest surface:

```js
import { guest } from "@lantharos/sabine";

const surface = await guest.create({
  url: "https://example.com",
  bounds: { x: 16, y: 64, width: 900, height: 600 },
  partition: "persist:browser",
  allowBridge: false,
});
await surface.setBounds({ x: 16, y: 64, width: 1100, height: 700 });
```

## Configuration

`Sabine.toml` describes the app and its web assets. `SabineWindow::main` loads it automatically;
the CLI supplies its source location during development and writes a relocated production manifest
when packaging:

```toml
[app]
id = "com.example.my-app"
name = "My App"
version = "1.0.0"
icon = "assets/icon.png"

[web]
root = "ui"
dist = "ui/dist"
entry = "ui/dist/index.html"
dev_port = 5173
build = "bun run build"

[updates]
provider = "github"
repository = "your-name/my-app"
channel = "stable"
policy = "automatic"
```

```sh
sabine install .
sabine update
sabine bundle . --target portable --release
sabine bundle . --target deb --release
sabine bundle . --target msi --release
sabine bundle . --target dmg --release
```

## Publishing and updates

Sabine uses one coordinated `vMAJOR.BUILD` GitHub Release for the CLI, service, daemon, and prebuilt CEF
host. The release workflow builds the complete system bundle for each platform and signs one
immutable release manifest. Bootstrap verifies the Ed25519 signature and artifact SHA-256 before
installing the binaries side by side. Customer machines do not compile Sabine or require Rust,
CMake, or a C++ toolchain. CEF remains a separately managed runtime and apps never select a
Chromium version.

New apps include a release workflow that calls Sabine's reusable workflow. Run the one-time release
setup from the app repository; it creates the app's signing key, stores the private seed directly as
a GitHub Actions secret, enables immutable Releases, and writes the repository and public key to
`Sabine.toml`:

```sh
sabine release-init --repository owner/repository
```

MSI builds require accepting the [WiX 7 EULA](https://docs.firegiant.com/wix/osmf/).
After reviewing its terms, add `accept_wix_eula: true` to the reusable release job's `with` inputs.
For local MSI builds, run `wix eula accept wix7` once on the build machine.

For each release, set the version in `Sabine.toml`, commit it, and push the matching tag:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The workflow builds MSI, DMG, AppImage, deb, and rpm artifacts, signs `sabine-update.json`, attaches
the exact platform/package mapping, attests the artifacts, and creates the GitHub Release. The daemon
downloads routine updates only after they have been live for 24 hours plus a stable per-installation
rollout offset of up to six hours. Sabine-managed archives activate side by side; their stable
bootstrap forwards to the current release on the next launch. Native packages are staged silently,
then offer Install or Later when the app next opens. Later snoozes the prompt for a day. Accepting
closes the app, requests elevation when needed, installs, and relaunches it. Store installs remain
owned by the store.

Windows bundles statically link the Microsoft C runtime. MSI packages are x64 and install for the current user under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\<app-id>`. Their wizard prepares the shared runtime before finishing,
supports repair, and uses the configured app icon for the Start menu shortcut. MSI failures roll
back packaged files and app registration; uninstall leaves the shared runtime available to other apps. The release workflow
installs and launches the MSI, verifies the app presents a Chromium frame, and checks that its
connection remains healthy before publishing it. Windows bundle targets are linked as GUI apps,
so existing apps do not need source-level linker configuration to avoid a console window.
Sabine's own service and daemon are also self-contained, and bootstrap tools run without creating
console windows; the native setup progress window is the only visible first-launch process.

`sabine bundle --target exe` creates a Windows setup wizard with NSIS 3.12. It installs for the
current user, prepares the shared runtime inside the installer, creates Start Menu shortcuts, and
registers an uninstaller. Setup shows progress and errors in its details pane and offers Retry when
preparation fails. Cancel stops setup, and failed upgrades restore the previous installation.
Rerun the installer to repair an installation; `/S` runs it silently. Uninstalling
an app retains shared Sabine components and user-created data.

Pass `--offline` to `sabine bundle` to include a working CEF runtime and Sabine system bootstrap.
The embedded system is adopted into the same versioned installation on first launch, then resumes
normal background updates. No compiler is needed on the destination machine.

## Runtime and service

Sabine keeps the Chromium runtime under the platform application-data directory. On Linux:

```text
~/.local/share/sabine/runtimes/cef/
```

`sabine-service` owns machine setup for every Sabine app. A separate
`sabine-service-daemon` executable performs background maintenance so Windows never attaches a
console window to the login process.

1. The first app launches with Sabine bootstrap code and a native progress window.
2. Bootstrap downloads the signed service, daemon, and prebuilt CEF host system bundle from the
   latest Sabine GitHub Release, installs it in a versioned directory, then starts it.
3. The service installs the latest compatible Chromium runtime and validates it with a headless CEF
   initialization before selecting it, independent of the daemon's graphical-session environment.
4. The app registers with the service and starts.

Later apps reuse that service and runtime. Updates are atomic: Sabine retains the previous system
version until the replacement daemon reports healthy. Exactly one daemon is active during handoff;
the old service binary acts as a short-lived supervisor, rolls back a failed replacement, and backs
off repeatedly failing releases. If the active installation is damaged, bootstrap silently replaces
it from signed release metadata. An app built for a newer Sabine build bypasses the routine rollout
delay and upgrades the shared system before registration. An app below the system's signed minimum
supported build keeps its registration and update eligibility, but gets a native explanation instead
of launching against an incompatible contract.

New system releases are published as immutable, non-latest candidates. After 24 hours an hourly
promotion job moves the newest eligible candidate to the `latest` channel, protecting older Sabine
installations that predate client-side soak enforcement. Current installations then apply their
stable zero-to-six-hour rollout offset. An app that explicitly requires the candidate build uses its
signed versioned manifest directly and can upgrade immediately.

Public Sabine versions use `MAJOR.BUILD`, so this source tree is `0.28`. Cargo and npm encode the same
release as `0.28.0` because their package formats require three components. Build releases remain
compatible within a major unless signed release metadata explicitly raises the minimum app build;
fundamental contract breaks increment the major.

Sabine 0.28 requires apps built with Sabine 0.23 or newer. Rebuild and redistribute older apps before
upgrading their shared system: the document-bound bridge and host protocol cannot be used by older
app binaries. macOS releases support Apple Silicon only. Rust builds require version 1.90 or newer.

CEF runtimes in active use hold leases so maintenance cannot prune them. A failed CEF initialization
is quarantined and resolution falls back to the previous runtime. Quarantines are scoped to the
health-probe version so a corrected probe automatically reconsiders runtimes it previously rejected.
By default the service also starts at login so the runtime stays warm.
Prefer on-demand start with `sabine-service prefer-on-demand`.

Service acquisition order:

1. `SABINE_SERVICE_PATH` if set
2. Active versioned installation under the Sabine data dir
3. Complete offline bootstrap beside the app, adopted into the versioned installation
4. Binary on `PATH` for development
5. The platform system bundle described by
   `https://github.com/Lantharos/Sabine/releases/latest/download/sabine-release.json`

Override the release metadata URL with `SABINE_RELEASE_MANIFEST_URL` for development or a private
mirror.

```sh
sabine runtime doctor
sabine runtime install
sabine runtime list
sabine runtime prune --keep 2

sabine-service install
sabine-service ensure
sabine-service list
sabine-service maintain
```

`sabine runtime doctor` validates the runtime layout and launches the matching CEF host with a
headless smoke probe. Its JSON output includes `probe_error` when the host cannot start.

## License

Sabine is dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0. CEF and Chromium keep their own licenses; see
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

On Linux, runtime preparation places ICU data beside `Release/libcef.so`, where Chromium loads it before browser resource settings apply. This preparation also runs when using a prebuilt Sabine host; it does not require rebuilding CEF or downloading an already complete runtime.
